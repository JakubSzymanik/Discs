Project created around 2018 by myself - Jakub Szymanik

Here's the gameplay video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Yott9P9Lwg
Here's the Google Play link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.JakubSzymanik.Discs

To play it you will need an older version of Android and the project will be hard to compile as it contains some outdated packages and old editor versions,
but i don't think it's worth updating so I'm just publishing it to show my code
